## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project help to reinforce the use of flexbox in a responsive design. It helped to reinforce the mobile first desgin method as well as improve html structure.

### Continued development

The section that I want to continue to focus on is making the site more responsive when dealing with growing elements. The container with plan details was the most challenging to format correctly. I want to improve the responsiveness of the plan detail container so that as it grows it keeps it's design properly.
